# MY CAPSTONE PROJECT - SALES DATA ANALYSIS
Here is my experience with Google Data Analytics thus far, what I have learned, and my final project for the course.
I employed the 6 steps of Data Analytics: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

# About The Project
This is the entire Sales (Customers and Products) dataset from Ali Ahmad. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 for cleaning and analysis. For my visualizations, I used Power BI.
